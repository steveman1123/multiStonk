  # If the price is rising in an uptrend but the volume is reducing or unchanged, it may show that there's little interest in the security, and the price may reverse. Similarly, when the price is rapidly declining but the volume is low, it could mean that the institutional traders are not interested in the price direction. So the price will soon reverse to the upside.
