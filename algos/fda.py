# https://finance.yahon.com/news/cara-therapeutics-announces-topline-results-110000707.html
# ^ check how insider trading is, and upcoming important dates (like announcements of phase results, etc)
# if it still falls significantly despite those, then wait at least a week and then make a decision based on the articles being posted
#TODO: should check history to make sure that the price isn't consistently decreasing
