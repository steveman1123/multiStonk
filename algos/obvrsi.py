'''
if the close of a price bar is higher than the previous price bar close, then obv=curvol+prevobv
if close of price bar is lower that previous close, then obv=prevobv-curvol
if curclose=prevclose, then obv=obvprev

absolute value not too important, but movement/trend is
if there's a huge spike in volume, the signal can be very unreliable
might be good idea to smooth it and take a derivitive? - if positive for multiple periods, then good buy, else good sell?

logic being something like this:
if (derivs over some period of time)>0 and isValid (that is, volume not significantly different than the avg)
might also be good to combine with rsi

rsi = avg gains/avg losses over given time frames
buy when oversold (rsi<30, then comes back>=30) and sell when overbought (rsi>100 then comes back<=70)

Similarly, when the price is rapidly declining but the volume is low, it could mean that the institutional traders are not interested in the price direction. So the price will soon reverse to the upside.
