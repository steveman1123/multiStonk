This is a mirror implementation of the [main repo](https://github.com/steveman1123/multiStonk) to be used with robinhood. 

It is not a complete implementation of the main repo. Experimental features are implemented.




TODO:
- Add support for multiple accounts
- Implement all features of the main repo without re-writing code.
- create functions in the main repo and call them instead of writing code.
- Add support for Docker.
- Getting stocks data from apis instead support.
