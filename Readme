This is a mirror implementation of the [main repo](https://github.com/steveman1123/multiStonk) to be used with robinhood. 

It is not a complete implementation of the main repo. Experimental features are implemented.

Goal:
- Implement all features of the main repo without breaking the main repo.




TODO:

- Add support for multiple accounts
