This is a mirror implementation of the [main repo](https://github.com/steveman1123/multiStonk) to be used with robinhood. 



This is experimental.

required for login: - TOTPS and alpaca API keys 
    


Moved all stocks required for trading to  multistock-server which is running on a server and returns the data in a json format. This is done for maintenance reasons and to debug failing apis.

using graphql will be too much work, so we request data individually from the api.
marketwatch you will have to post parameters to the api.

    requests.post(url = "https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/stock")

notes:
graphql may help, but thats too much code. It is better to use the api directly.
