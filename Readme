This is a mirror implementation of the [main repo](https://github.com/steveman1123/multiStonk) to be used with robinhood. 



This is experimental.

required for login: - TOTPS and alpaca API keys 
    

Moved all stocks required for trading to  multistock-server which is running on a server and returns the data in a json format. This is done for maintenance reasons and to debug failing apis in the future.


TODO:

- [x] Add trading time from main repo.
- [x] Add support for robinhood and alpaca
- [x] Implement all features of the main repo without re-writing code.


- [x] write createOrder function using limit order.
- [x] write sell function.

- [x] Add support for Docker for getting api server for future needs.
- [x] Do a pull requests 

- [x] prevent duplicate orders during limit orders.
- [x] fix limit orders and syncing issues. 

- [ ] A Docker instance or create systemd background simple task for the server to run in the background. 
- [ ] The server is managing the watchlist and sending email alerts.

- [ ] write watchlist class function.
- [ ] write email class.
- [ ] Add support for watchlist.
- [ ] Add support emailing alerts and news.


notes:
Robinhood hours for trading has changed, keeping the original hours. 

graphql may help, but thats too much work. It is better to use the api directly instead of querying.
