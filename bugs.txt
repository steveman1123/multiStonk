in poslistmulti.json:
  lasttradedate and lasttradetype are NA, why?


things apear to be selling periodically, but not triggering up, why?

multistonk ~line 440, add verbosity for showing when a stock is added to the stock info

~510: don't jusr discard, attempt to sell firs for a few times, and after some attempts, then discard, and before attempting to sell, make sure it's tradable on alpaca, logic should be:
not in ndaq:
  if isAlpacaTradable:
    get price from alpaca
  else:
    remove from tradable stocks

ndaqfxn - getprices to use a dict instead of list, then update uses of it in other files

add more verbosity to more functions


still attempts to buy stocks even though cash is less than mincash2hold and then that buying_power < cost_basis


throwing an error when buying that the order is not accepted, why? Probably related to the previous problem too
